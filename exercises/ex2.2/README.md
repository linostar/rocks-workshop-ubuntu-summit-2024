# Instructions for Exercise 2.2

Figure out how to write a `rockcraft.yaml` for a chiselled MySQL server rock, that runs the mysqld daemon with `mysql` user.

You can use mysql slices from repo github.com/zhijie-yang/chisel-releases, branch `final-mysql-24.04`.

Since you will be using slices and not packages, you have to create the `mysql` user yourself in `rockcraft.yaml`.

Bonus: try to configure the usernames/passwords/db_names in your `rockcraft.yaml` as well.
